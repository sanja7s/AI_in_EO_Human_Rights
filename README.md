# AI in EO Human Rights

**Implications of Human Right Values by the uses of AI in Earth Observation**

We provide three Notebooks:

1) generates AI in EO uses
2) assesses the risk of those uses according to the EU AI Act
3) assesses the implications of those uses on human right values across the 30 articles of UDHR


We also include the list of domains and the AI in EO uses that we generated along with their risk descriptions.
